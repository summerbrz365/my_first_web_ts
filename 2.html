    No matter which MINI Cooper colors you’re considering, you’ll see that these compact luxury SAVs® have no trouble standing out on Minnetonka roads. Today’s lineup includes six MINI Cooper models–the Hardtop 2 Door, the Hardtop 4 Door, the all-new electric Hardtop 2 Door SE, the Convertible, the Clubman, and the Countryman–and each is available in a splendid array of eye-catching shades.
We’ve laid out all of the exterior color options that are offered, and highlighted several new additions that will be introduced in model-year 2024! We’ve even covered the current range of MINI Cooper interior colors so you’ll know exactly what to look for when you start browsing our inventory.
